### Write one paragraph summarizing your findings 

There were 3 years that had noticeably higher almond years than the 1983-2003 average: 1995, 2005, and 2008. The average minimum January temperature for these years were 11.6 C, 9.5 C, and 8.5 C, respectively. The average minimum January temperature for all years was approximately 8.7 C; years 1995 and 2005 had higher than average temperatures, which could potentially be contributing to their higher almond yields. Regarding precipitation, years 1995 and 2008 had fairly low totals. In 2005, precipitation totals were 213 mm, greater than the average total precipitation of years 1989-2010, which averaged approximately 142 mm.

On the other hand, the years with the lowest almond yield anomalies were: 1989, 1999, 2003, and 2004. These years had yields that were lower than the 1983-2008 average. From these low yield years, all years except 2003 had average temperatures that were lower than the 8.7 average. Interestingly, years with low almond yields did not have significantly less precipitation than years with high yields, besides 1999, which had 0 mm of February precipitation. 

Overall, there is not a clear trend of how the average January minimum temperature and total February precipitation affects almond yield anomalies. There may be more information that is needed to draw definite conclusions. For example, there could have been agricultural pests that decimated crops or issues with pollinator activity. However, our function, 'yield_anomaly.R' can be used by almond farmers to predict their almond yield based on minimum temperature and total rainfall parameters.
