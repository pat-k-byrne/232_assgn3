#' Almond Yield Anomaly
#' 
#' Function to calculate the almond yield difference from the 1980-2003 average (ton/acre)
#' Function output: a matrix with two columns. Column 1 is input years and column 2 is calculated yield anomaly
#' @param precip A vector of total precipitation in the month of January (in mm)
#' @param min_temp A vector of mean minimum daily temperature in the month of February
#' @param years.calc A vector of the years for which you would like to calculate yield anomaly (must be the same lenth as precip and min_temp)
